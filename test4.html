        Authors and actors and artists and such<br />
        Never know nothing, and never know much.<br />
        Sculptors and signers and those of their kidney<br />
        Tell their affairs from Seattle to Sydney.

        Playwrights and poets and such horses' necks<br />
        Start off from anywhere, end up at sex.<br />
        Diarists, critics, and similar roe<br />
        Never say nothing, and never say no.
